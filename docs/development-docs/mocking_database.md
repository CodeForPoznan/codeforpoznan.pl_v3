## Generating mock data
You may want to generate fake data for development and testing purposes, especially for the intranet functionalities. We created a script to that end that you may use with the command:
```
make populate_database
```

### Logging into the app
Once you populate database generated user e-mails will be prompted in your terminal. You can copy one of them and use as credentials to log into the app in the `localhost:8080/login` route.

Default user password is:
`pass123`
